# github-in-government
Interested in using GitHub within the Government? Here's a starting point


## Join the Government Peer Group
The government community on GitHub is a collaborative community for sharing best practices in furtherance of open source, open data, and open government efforts. To encourage an open dialog, the community is a semi-private community, with only government employees having access.

Anyone with a government email address is encouraged to participate, including national/federal, state, local, and municipal employees. That means if your email ends in .gov, .gov.uk, ci.champaign.il.us, etc., you are eligible. You simply must have a verified government email address associated with your account. 

More information on how to join can be found at https://github.com/government/welcome#how-to-join.
